The outer sole is so thin that although I wear them almost completely in the house on rugs the inner padding is showing through in the heel.

(wanna guess?) I am so happy with these, I did get them on sale, which helped me a lot, but honestly, these are truly worth more. The\y are so comfortable, the arch is awesome, the cushioning, which is my number one issue (fat woman, 35 years working intensive care) is amazing. I love that the tongue is super thin and doesn't get in the way. I love the lacing system, but i needed a little more room in the shoe, some days it works great, other days i wish i just had one more inch, lol. Are you looking for an amazing shoe? Cushioning, smooth rocker bottom?? These are them, I couldn't be happier. I also introduced them to another friend who worked ICU with me for many years, she bought them and adores them too!!!

So, I ordered size 7 even though I usually wear 7.5 or 8. However, size 6 was arrived to my home. The funny thing was it fits to me and I am wearing the shoes. Consequently, tt is way smaller than I expected.<br /><br />Besides the size thing, it is comfortable and easy to wear and take off. If you are considering buying this, one thing you need to notice is that the rare part of the shoes is lower than common shoes.<br /><br />I satisfied this purchase but I gave 4 stars because of its small size.",31-08-2015

I don't have any special arch support issues so I can't make a judgement on that attribute. The shoes are SUPER light weight, yet seem to be sturdy. The real test will be to see how long they last.

I do find that I need to lace them up pretty tight to keep my toes from rubbing the composite protective toe on the boot but all in all they seem like a good boot right from the box.  My rule of thumb is to get 1 year for every $100 I spend.  I would guess that in roughly a year the soles will start cracking which is also typical for timberland boots.  But they are work boots and I do beat them up for that year, and quite honestly they are comfortable.",31-08-2015

I love that the tongue is super thin and doesn't get in the way. I love the lacing system, but i needed a little more room in the shoe, some days it works great, other days i wish i just had one more inch, lol. Are you looking for an amazing shoe?

So, I ordered size 7 even though I usually wear 7.5 or 8. However, size 6 was arrived to my home. The funny thing was it fits to me and I am wearing the shoes. Consequently, tt is way smaller than I expected.<br /><br />Besides the size thing, it is comfortable and easy to wear and take off.

I don't have any special arch support issues so I can't make a judgement on that attribute. The shoes are SUPER light weight, yet seem to be sturdy. The real test will be to see how long they last.

My rule of thumb is to get 1 year for every $100 I spend.  I would guess that in roughly a year the soles will start cracking which is also typical for timberland boots.  But they are work boots and I do beat them up for that year, and quite honestly they are comfortable.",31-08-2015

I purchased mine in Coffee color. Shipping was fast.<br /><br />Every compartment zips which is nice with keeping things in. The main compartment has son padding witch gives the bag done structure and helps protect an iPad. It holds quite a bit but it's not a huge bag, my iPad mini fits nicely in its case with room to spare. The side pockets are great for an iPhone 5 in a fitted case but an iPhone 6 would be to big but the many othe pockets would work nicely.<br />The strap is soft and comfortable. The zippers are smooth and functional. My only complaint is the lining is a little cheap but it does not bunch up and get in the way.<br /><br />I usually carry Fossil or Vera Bradley bags. I got this for something different and small.",31-08-2015

So, I ordered size 7 even though I usually wear 7.5 or 8. However, size 6 was arrived to my home. The funny thing was it fits to me and I am wearing the shoes. Consequently, tt is way smaller than I expected.<br /><br />Besides the size thing, it is comfortable and easy to wear and take off.

I don't have any special arch support issues so I can't make a judgement on that attribute. The shoes are SUPER light weight, yet seem to be sturdy. The real test will be to see how long they last.

More sturdy than a slip on, but less bulky than a true sneaker. I had a pair in yellow that I got all greasy from biking, so I switched over to black.  They're holding up well, comfortable, and seem like they would survive a run through the washing machine if I wanted to clean them up.  Very happy with my purchase.",31-08-2015

They are not heavy to wear all day.  I do find that I need to lace them up pretty tight to keep my toes from rubbing the composite protective toe on the boot but all in all they seem like a good boot right from the box.  My rule of thumb is to get 1 year for every $100 I spend.  I would guess that in roughly a year the soles will start cracking which is also typical for timberland boots.  But they are work boots and I do beat them up for that year, and quite honestly they are comfortable.",31-08-2015

I purchased mine in Coffee color. Shipping was fast.<br /><br />Every compartment zips which is nice with keeping things in. The main compartment has son padding witch gives the bag done structure and helps protect an iPad. It holds quite a bit but it's not a huge bag, my iPad mini fits nicely in its case with room to spare. The side pockets are great for an iPhone 5 in a fitted case but an iPhone 6 would be to big but the many othe pockets would work nicely.<br />The strap is soft and comfortable.

So, I ordered size 7 even though I usually wear 7.5 or 8. However, size 6 was arrived to my home. The funny thing was it fits to me and I am wearing the shoes. Consequently, tt is way smaller than I expected.<br /><br />Besides the size thing, it is comfortable and easy to wear and take off.

I don't have any special arch support issues so I can't make a judgement on that attribute. The shoes are SUPER light weight, yet seem to be sturdy. The real test will be to see how long they last.
