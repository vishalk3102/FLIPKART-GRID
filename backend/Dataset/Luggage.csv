I specifically wanted a cross-body bag for security that also had carry handles and a front zipped pocket for easy access to my phone.  This bag is really nice looking, sturdy and yet lightweight enough to be carried all day. The interior pockets were great for passports and sun glasses and the main pocket was big enough to hold multiple items including a water bottle. I used the small magnetic closing pocket on the front for lotion, makeup and tissues, and the back slip pocket was great for museum and train tickets.  This has definitely become my favorite travel bag. Very highly recommended!",31-08-2015

The stitching, workmanship and hardware all appear to be good quality.  It's not a huge bag, but big enough for a weekend if you travel light.  Fits easily into plane overhead lockers.<br />The neutral:  the buckles for access into the main compartment are strong and will definitely last longer than any zipper would.  However they don't provide easy access into the body of the bag if you need something quickly and obviously don't completely seal the bag from the outside as a zipper would.<br />The bad:  the magnetic clasps on the outside pockets. The clasps are not at all secure and readily unfasten when you don't want them to.  They will unfasten when the bag brushes against anything like a chair, armrest or other luggage in the overhead compartment, or even when it tangles with its own s...",31-08-2015

For some reason, I have no idea why, I usually am unable to find things easily in my purses.  I don't carry a huge bag with everything but the kitchen sink in my purse, just the normal stuff, money, chapstick, compact brush, checkbooks, emergency feminine hygiene products, gum, some medications in small containers, car keys, etc.  Everything would always get lost in my purse and I'd have to dig around to find stuff.  Well, since getting this, I no longer have to search forever for things I need to retrieve.  This has several pockets to hold smaller items from getting lost at the bottom of your purse, a main compartment that is large enough to hold the things I need to carry, an outside zippered pocket, a mini flashlight, a flat bottom to stand up on it's own, and two small handles making it easy to take out of one purse and stick into another.  I purchased this just before a trip and it has been a lifesaver.",31-08-2015

Well, since getting this, I no longer have to search forever for things I need to retrieve.  This has several pockets to hold smaller items from getting lost at the bottom of your purse, a main compartment that is large enough to hold the things I need to carry, an outside zippered pocket, a mini flashlight, a flat bottom to stand up on it's own, and two small handles making it easy to take out of one purse and stick into another.

The stitching, workmanship and hardware all appear to be good quality.  It's not a huge bag, but big enough for a weekend if you travel light.  Fits easily into plane overhead lockers.<br />The neutral:  the buckles for access into the main compartment are strong and will definitely last longer than any zipper would.  However they don't provide easy access into the body of the bag if you need something quickly and obviously don't completely seal the bag from the outside as a zipper would.<br />The bad:  the magnetic clasps on the outside pockets. The clasps are not at all secure and readily unfasten when you don't want them to.  They will unfasten when the bag brushes against anything like a chair, armrest or other luggage in the overhead compartment, or even when it tangles with its own s...",31-08-2015

For some reason, I have no idea why, I usually am unable to find things easily in my purses.  I don't carry a huge bag with everything but the kitchen sink in my purse, just the normal stuff, money, chapstick, compact brush, checkbooks, emergency feminine hygiene products, gum, some medications in small containers, car keys, etc.  Everything would always get lost in my purse and I'd have to dig around to find stuff.  Well, since getting this, I no longer have to search forever for things I need to retrieve.  This has several pockets to hold smaller items from getting lost at the bottom of your purse, a main compartment that is large enough to hold the things I need to carry, an outside zippered pocket, a mini flashlight, a flat bottom to stand up on it's own, and two small handles making it easy to take out of one purse and stick into another.

Well, since getting this, I no longer have to search forever for things I need to retrieve.  This has several pockets to hold smaller items from getting lost at the bottom of your purse, a main compartment that is large enough to hold the things I need to carry, an outside zippered pocket, a mini flashlight, a flat bottom to stand up on it's own, and two small handles making it easy to take out of one purse and stick into another.

11854817,RGZ2HP8SH629Q,B003DGJ9PU,Travelon Rfid Blocking Purse Organizer,Luggage,5,Great organizer for the abyss (a purse),"Fits well in my purse and makes organizing much easier.  For some reason, I have no idea why, I usually am unable to find things easily in my purses.  I don't carry a huge bag with everything but the kitchen sink in my purse, just the normal stuff, money, chapstick, compact brush, checkbooks, emergency feminine hygiene products, gum, some medications in small containers, car keys, etc.  Everything would always get lost in my purse and I'd have to dig around to find stuff.  Well, since getting this, I no longer have to search forever for things I need to retrieve.  This has several pockets to hold smaller items from getting lost at the bottom of your purse, a main compartment that is large enough to hold the things I need to carry, an outside zippered pocket, a mini flashlight, a flat bottom to stand up on it's own, and two small handles making it easy to take out of one purse and stick into another.  I purchased this just before a trip and it has been a lifesaver.",31-08-2015

This has several pockets to hold smaller items from getting lost at the bottom of your purse, a main compartment that is large enough to hold the things I need to carry, an outside zippered pocket, a mini flashlight, a flat bottom to stand up on it's own, and two small handles making it easy to take out of one purse and stick into another.

I placed the bag outside overnight to help the smell (it didn't), so I am hoping it goes away over time. Also there was what I assume was a leather cleaning or care wax, but there were no instructions for use, so I guess I will not be using. My laptop, agenda a few pens and my charger should all fit fine. It says leather, but it does not have that traditional leather smell to it.",31-08-2015

Well, since getting this, I no longer have to search forever for things I need to retrieve.  This has several pockets to hold smaller items from getting lost at the bottom of your purse, a main compartment that is large enough to hold the things I need to carry, an outside zippered pocket, a mini flashlight, a flat bottom to stand up on it's own, and two small handles making it easy to take out of one purse and stick into another.
